Q5;Comparison of Rapid Application Design and Spiral;Spiral methodology is a sophisticated liftcycle model that focus on early identification and reduction of projects risks. It derives its rapid development method not from an increase in project speed, but from continuously reducting the project risk level. Rapid Application Development(RAD) on the other hand, is a general term that refets to any programming lanaguage that offers speedier implementation than traditional languages. It produces their savings by reducing the amount of construction needed to build a project.
Q6;Principles of Language Development;The basic principles of language development is "Efficiency on Executiong", "Realibility on the Environment", "Regularity with the Integrates Features", "Orthogonality Independence", "Extensibility with the built-in" and "Security".
