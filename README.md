 This project was initially developed while I am still a student. This project is primarily developed to demonstrate the implementation of Advance Data Structure and Algorithm. The technique includes:

 * Dynamic Array Manipulation
 * 2-Dimensional Array
 * File IO (Reading from a txt)
 * Binary Search
 * Merge Sort

 This was a 8-weeks project that gone through a complete SDLC cycle. The complete SRS Documentation can be found in my Dropbox:
